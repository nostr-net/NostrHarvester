 # Improvement Progress

 This file tracks progress on the improvement plan described in `improvement_plan.md`.

 ## Overall Plan

 ### Phase 1 (High Impact, Low Risk)
- [x] Database migrations, indexing, and query optimization
- [x] Basic monitoring and health checks
- [x] Configuration management improvements

 ### Phase 2 (High Impact, Medium Risk)
- [x] Event processing batching and worker pools  
- [x] Circuit breaker pattern for relay management  
- [x] Security enhancements and rate limiting  

 ## Phase 1 Detailed Sub-tasks

#### 1. Database migrations, indexing, and query optimization
- [x] Implement versioned database migrations framework:
  - Create migrations directory
  - Add migrations tracking table and runner
- [x] Create initial schema migration from `schema.sql`
- [x] Create migrations for adding necessary indexes:
  - Composite index on (created_at DESC)
  - Index on (pubkey, created_at DESC)
  - Index on (kind, created_at DESC)
  - Full-text search index on content (PostgreSQL)
  - JSONB index on tags array
- [x] Remove legacy `schema.sql` file
- [x] Validate migrations on a fresh database and run performance tests
- [x] Add Docker Compose 'migrate' service to run migrations after db container starts

 #### 2. Basic monitoring and health checks
 - [x] Add `/health` HTTP endpoint checking critical dependencies (database connectivity).
 - [x] Integrate Prometheus client library for metrics.
 - [x] Add `/metrics` HTTP endpoint exposing Prometheus metrics.
 - [x] Add configuration entries for enabling/disabling metrics and health checks.

#### 3. Configuration management improvements
 - [x] Introduce a centralized configuration loader module.
 - [x] Support hierarchical configuration: defaults, config file, environment variables.
 - [x] Replace scattered hard-coded values with config references.
 - [x] Add config validation on startup.
 - [x] Update project documentation with new configuration instructions.

## Phase 2 Detailed Sub-tasks

#### 1. Event processing batching and worker pools
- [x] Add batching in EventProcessor (configurable batch size & interval)
- [x] Implement multiple worker tasks based on worker_pool_size
- [x] Update Storage to support bulk insert for events and event sources
- [x] Add deduplication logic in batch processor

#### 2. Circuit breaker pattern for relay management
- [x] Create CircuitBreaker class to track failures and state per relay
- [x] Integrate circuit breaker into RelayManager.connect_all for add_relay calls
- [x] Skip relays with open circuit until recovery timeout

#### 3. Security enhancements and rate limiting
- [x] Add rate limiting middleware in API (per-IP, configurable requests/minute)
- [x] Enforce max_event_query_limit in /api/events endpoint
- [x] Add input validation limits (e.g., limit <= max_event_query_limit)

## Phase 3 Detailed Sub-tasks

#### 1. Advanced query performance
- [x] Implement materialized views for common aggregates
- [x] Add caching layer for expensive queries (configurable, default disabled)
- [x] Add connection pooling configuration and tuning

#### 2. Configuration hot-reloading and dynamic updates
- [x] Support runtime config reload without service restart
- [x] Add file-watch mechanism and safe reload paths

#### 3. Extended observability
- [x] Add health checks for internal queues and external dependencies
- [x] Expose gauge metrics for queue sizes and active connections
- [x] Add custom business metrics (events per relay, user activity)

#### 4. Security hardening
- [x] Enforce request size limits for API endpoints
- [x] Add input sanitization filters for content fields
- [x] Integrate authentication/authorization for critical endpoints
